<h2>Not functioning anymore due to constant changes regarding data collection on X (formerly Twitter)</h2>


Used tweets from X (formerly twitter) regarding a specific stock and used the opinion expressed by the people to help determine how the stock price would change according to the tweets. Main area of focus for this project was Sentiment Analysis and classification. We used a rule based approach in sorting our tweets in whether they were positive, negative or neutral. Each tweet was given a score and the overall score would help us in determining how stock would be affected. selection of tweets could range from 100 all the way to 10000.

Technologies used: React, Python, HTML, CSS, Flask, Tailwind, Javascript, RestAPI

Conclusion: While the project showed some correlation based on user sentiment, it could not be the only factor in determining how the stock would perform. More sources would be need to give a very accurate prediction for the stock. 

Learning: This project allowed me to explore the world of Sentiment analysis and how important it is to businesses. This project also allowed me to learn about RESTAPI (how to establish a connection between API endpoints.) and React, which was used to make the frontend of our project.
